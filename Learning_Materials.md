## Domain Adaptation

Transfer learning involves mapping data from diverse source domains and target domains, each with unique distributions, into a shared feature space. The primary goal is to minimize the dissimilarity between these domains within the feature space. By achieving this, the objective function trained on the source domain within the feature space can be effectively transferred to the target domain, leading to enhanced accuracy in the target domain.

## Object Detection

Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and localizing multiple objects within an image or video.
